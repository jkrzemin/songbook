{c: Verse 1}
[Am]Psychic spies from China
Try to [F]steal your mind's elation
[Am]Little girls from Sweden
Dream of [F]silver screen quotations
And [C]if you want these [G]kind of dreams
It's [F]Californi[Dm]cation

{c: Verse 2}
It's the[Am] edge of the world

It's [C]understood that [G]Hollywood
sells [F]Californi[Dm]cation

[Am]Pay your surgeon very well
To [Fmaj7]break the spell of aging
Ce[Am]lebrity skin, is this your chin?
Or [Fmaj7]is that war you're waging?
[Am]   First born unic[Fmaj7]orn
[Am]   Hardcore soft p[Fmaj7]orn

{c: Verse 3}
[Am]Marry me girl, be my fairy to the world
Be my [F]very own constellation
A [Am]teenage bride with a baby inside
Getting [F]high on information
And [C]buy me a star on the [G]boulevard
It's [F]Californi[Dm]cation

{c: Verse 4}
[Am]Space may be the final frontier
But it's [F]made in a Hollywood basement
And [Am]Cobain can you hear the spheres
Singing [F]songs off station to station?
And [C]Alderaan's not [G]far away
It's [F]Californi[Dm]cation

  [Am]Ooooo - [Fmaj7]ooooh   [Am]Oooo -  [Fmaj7]ooooh

{c: Pre-Chorus 2}
[Am]Born and raised by those who praise
Con[Fmaj7]trol of population

[Am]   First born unic[Fmaj7]orn
[Am]   Hardcore soft p[Fmaj7]orn

{c: Verse 5}
Des[Am]truction leads to a very rough road
But it [F]also breeds creation
And [Am]earthquakes are to a girl's guitar
They're [F]just another good vibration
And [C]tidal waves couldn't [G]save the world
From [F]Californi[Dm]cation

{c: Interlude}
  [Am]Ooooo - [Fmaj7]ooooh   [Am]Oooo -  [Fmaj7]ooooh

{c: Pre-Chorus 3}
[Am]Pay your surgeon very well
To [Fmaj7]break the spell of aging
[Am]Sicker than the rest, there is no test
But [Fmaj7]this is what you're craving
[Am]   First born unic[Fmaj7]orn
[Am]   Hardcore soft p[Fmaj7]orn
